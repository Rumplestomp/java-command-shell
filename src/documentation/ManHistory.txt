Description:
    - history: returns a numbered list of all the commands, or last n commands
               that the user has inputted since the beginning of the session
               in JShell. The history command itself will be the latest recorded
               command when the command is called. (i.e. history 1 will display
               x. history 1
               where x is the index number of the command call)
	
Usage:
    - history
	- history <int>
	
Additional Comments:
    - If the user puts a number that is larger than the list of history,
      by default, the command will output all of the recorded commands rather
      than throwing an out of index type error. If the user enters 0, the
      command will be recorded, but wont print anything. Negative numbers will
      throw errors.
