What did I do last time?
    - Created Command interface which all commands will implement
    - Created skeleton of the CommandManager class (HashMap and function signature)
    - Updated CRC Cards to reflect the new design pattern and interactions between Command, CommandManager, and CommandArgs
    - Brainstormed implementation details for certain commands

What do I plan to do now?
    - Begin implementing commands
    - Update the CommandManager for the commands created
    - Plan implementation details for CommandManager
    - Plan out how to test commands created so far, with or without a working JShell (or any other necessary parts)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Nothing blocked for assigned items in Sprint 1
