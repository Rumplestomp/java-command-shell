What did I do last time?
    - Added injection console system for commands
    - Added a command description system
    - Finalizing code and fixing any bugs found in the project
    - Add/updating and finalizing JUnit tests for CmdMan, CmdEcho, CmdExit, CmdFind and TestingConsole.

What do I plan to do now?
    - Continue overlooking the project and testing the JShell as a whole

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Nope
