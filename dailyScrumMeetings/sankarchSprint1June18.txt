What did I do last time?
    - Created the structure of the JShell program
    - Commented the code needed to complete the JShell implementation
    - Put in place temporary means of having the JShell function
    - Brainstormed ideas on how to structure the commands
    - Brainstormed ideas on how to create the exit condition for the JShell

What do I plan to do now?
    - Plan ahead to be able to smoothly integrate the needed components for JShell to work
    - Finish the implementation of JShell
    - Finalize the necessary instance and static variables of JShell
    - Brainstorm ways to instantiate the root directory of the system

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Waiting on the completion of certain components that JShell depends on
    - CommandManger being the main dependency, as well as the file and directory objects
