What did I do last time?
    - Change command description to use new class greff made
    - Rework the command description to use the builder pattern
    - Refactor commands to be more DRY
      - Moved name up to the superclass
      - Moved description up to the superclass
      - Moved their getters up to the superclass

What do I plan to do now?
    - Add more test for my commands
    - Make crc cards that are missing

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Nope
