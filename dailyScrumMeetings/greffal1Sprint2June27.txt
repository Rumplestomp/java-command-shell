What did I do last time?
    - Worked on bug fixes for CmdEcho, CmdFind and CmdMan
    - Communicating with team and making changes to CommandManager as well as
      the general command process
    - Coded CmdExit

What do I plan to do now?
    - Add more tests for my assigned commands
    - Test the whole project in general

Am I blocked on anything?
    - CmdMkdir and CmdCat need to be implemented in order for me to test the
      functionality of JShell fully
