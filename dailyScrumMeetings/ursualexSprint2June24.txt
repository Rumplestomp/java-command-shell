What did I do last time?
    - Got a working implementation of the CommandManager
    - Helped make some tweaks to CommandManager as our ideas changed
    - Studied the implementation of other classes, to know how to use them when implementing commands
    - Planned out and have a good idea of the implementation of my assigned commands

What do I plan to do now?
    - Implement my assigned commands
    - Complete documentation for my assigned commands
    - Brainstorm some test cases for my assigned commands, and possible others

Am I blocked on anything?
    - No
