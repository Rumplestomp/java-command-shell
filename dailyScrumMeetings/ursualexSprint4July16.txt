What did I do last time?
    - Created new methods for filesystem to get string representation of the path
    leading to a file or directory (then refactored into an older method)
    - Completed implementation for the grep command (switched tasks since last meeting)
    - Completed most documentation for the grep command

What do I plan to do now?
    - Complete comments and documentation for the grep command
    - Create test file for grep command
    - Create tests for the file system methods
    - Update tests of commands previously responsible for

Am I blocked on anything?
    - No
